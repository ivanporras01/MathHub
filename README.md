# MathHub by Mr. Porras

An independent MathHub classroom with six courses and 72 original introductory practice topics: 6th Grade Math, 7th Grade Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and Geometry. Each course has 12 topics with explanations, illustrations, worked examples, guided steps, fresh numeric practice, hints, and solutions. This is an introductory practice collection, not a complete course or a formal gradebook.

## Student access and progress

Students join with first and last names. Returning with the same normalized spelling restores the same profile and saved progress across devices. Students with identical full names need distinct name variations agreed with Mr. Porras. Sign out on shared devices. These name-based profiles support practice; they do not verify identity.

Mastery requires the Learn and Guided stages plus five independent first-try correct answers. Supported answers still count as correct practice. Activity indicates a recent visible-page heartbeat, not verified attention.

## Professor access

Open `/teacher`. Use the private professor access phrase. Capitalization, spaces, and hyphens are ignored. Sessions last eight hours, or 30 days when the personal-device checkbox is selected. Secure HttpOnly cookies, hashed server sessions, expiry, sign-out, rotation, and persistent login limits protect the dashboard. Never commit real credentials or their hashes.

The dashboard provides course and activity filters, topic progress, help requests, CSV export, a student-link copy button, and student removal with confirmation. Removing a student deletes that profile and its records, leaving other students intact.

The Cloudflare deployment uses the professor phrase and ignores caller-supplied identity headers. The original optional Sites adapter is retained in the source, but this repository has no Sites project identity or shared deployment manifest.

## Hosting

This repository is `ivanporras01/MathHub`, with its own `main` branch and history. It is an independent project. Production secrets are configured through Cloudflare, never in source. The Worker is named `mathhub`; its Durable Object namespace and records belong to that Worker. MathPath is not a dependency.

| Resource | MathHub configuration |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub repository | `ivanporras01/MathHub` |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Cloudflare Worker | `mathhub` |
| Cloudflare configuration | `wrangler.cloudflare.json` |
| Classroom identifier | `mr-porras-mathhub-classroom` |
| Student route | `/` |
| Professor route | `/teacher` |

For Cloudflare deployment, connect this repository's `main` branch to the Worker named `mathhub` and use `wrangler.cloudflare.json`. Publication remains pending until account authentication and the professor secret are configured.

- Build command: `npm run build:cloudflare`
- Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.cloudflare.json`
- Student route: `/`
- Professor route: `/teacher`

Cloudflare provisions SQLite Durable Object storage from the configuration. Before classroom use, set the secret `TEACHER_CODE_SHA256` to the SHA-256 of the professor phrase uppercased with spaces and hyphens removed. The normalized phrase must contain 12–64 alphanumeric characters, with total input length at most 64. Use a unique random phrase. Without configuration the dashboard fails closed. `/api/health` reports whether the secret is configured, without disclosing it.

## Verification

- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit --incremental false`
- `node scripts/verify-cloudflare.mjs`
- `node scripts/verify-cloudflare.mjs --sites`
- `npm run build:cloudflare`
- `npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.cloudflare.json --dry-run --outdir work/worker`
- `node scripts/verify-worker.mjs`

Math checks independently calculate 12,960 questions across all 72 topics. Both server variants are tested for scoring, progress persistence, returning students, authorization, hints, retries, help, removal, session expiry, rate limits, and secure cookies including 30-day sign-in. The standalone Worker bundle is also checked in the Cloudflare SQLite runtime. Test-only credentials in these scripts are public fixtures and must never be used in production. Browser visual and interaction QA was unavailable in this development environment.
